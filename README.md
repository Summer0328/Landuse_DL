# Landuse_DL
Land use classification or landform delineation from remote sensing images using Deep Learning

March 2018:
    Land use classification using the data from 2018_IEEE_GRSS_Data_Fusion. Also submitted the result. codes in "grss_data_fusion". 
    The method utilized Deeplab V4(+3), a semantic segmentation algorithm, to classify land use (20 classes). 
    
August 2018:
    Delineate retrogressive thaw slumps from Planet CubeSat images.
    
January 2019:
    Supporting of Mask RCNN

March 2019:
