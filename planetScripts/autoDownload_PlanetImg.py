# Data acquisition:
# The data acquisition using the Planet API downloader was simple and effective.
# The required data could be downloaded after adapting the tutorial for the personal needs.
# It is necessary to be careful which type of data you acquire, as there are different possibilities
# which include the Basic scene, Ortho scenes as well as Ortho tile scene (for further information see 1.1.2).
# After the data type selection is done, you receive a download link which is valid for 5 minutes.
# By clicking on it, the download starts, and you can save the image to your device.


# pre-install library
# python 2.7+, better to use Python 3
